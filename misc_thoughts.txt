-return to prog-extraction by berghofer?
-lattice of all stable matchings, and how gs always return a particular one in the lattice. see wikipedia 'optimality of the solution'
-split GS.thy into multiple files???

do
-use try0 everywhere to shorten proofs
-unify gs'-arg-seq to all use index form
-remove unnecessary uses of ?seq eg where they are only used in `seq=?seq`
-replace all instances of seq!i=(X,Y) with fst(seq!i) snd(seq!i)
	actually no, on second thought, why dont I instead use X,Y everywhere? in the statement of lemmas too. change all fst(seq!i) (snd(seq!i) TO XY?
-organize using <sections> functionality
-eventually: remove unused lemmas
-a stable match is: counter example doesnt exist (no instability) + actually is a match (everyone gets married) (no one is married to 2 diff people) (ie a bijection)
-run codegen for evaluation purposes?
-submit to afp
