-return to prog-extraction by berghofer?
-lattice of all stable matchings, and how gs always return a particular one in the lattice. see wikipedia 'optimality of the solution'


do
-a stable match is: counter example doesnt exist (no instability) + actually is a match (everyone gets married) (no one is married to 2 diff people) (ie a bijection)
-is termination automatically checked?
	in terms of termination, basically do exactly what coq paper did.
	just follow the coq paper "introducing a measure for termination" and see how you might do this in isabelle/hol. it's pretty, gets rid of n^2.
-run codegen for evaluation purposes?
-multiple proof methods: 1 sim to coq; 2 sim to standard english-text proof (by contradiction, i think) (see wikipedia; probably need to encode temporality somehow)
-submit to afp
